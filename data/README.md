# README

Any data that is loaded from your scripts (excluding data scraped/downloaded from the web) should be uploaded to this folder. Simulated data should be reproducible.

# Notes on data

Primary data is in the subfolders. Datasets `combined_data.csv` and `combined_data1.csv` are produced by the `data_for_reg.ipynb` code, and image `vis_example.png` by the `Visualisation.ipynb` code (using the primary data).
